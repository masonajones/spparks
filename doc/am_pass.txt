am_pass command :h3

[Syntax:]

am_pass id dir d distance D speed V init_heading B :pre

id = integer identification number for this pass
dir = required keyword
d = {X} or {Y} which specifies direction of the cartesian pass
distance = required keyword
D = total pass distance
speed = required keyword
V = scan velocity of the pass in sites/Monte-Carlo-sweep
init_heading = optional keyword
B = {0} or {1} for a pass heading in the positive (default) or negative direction :ul

[Examples:]

am_pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0 :pre
am_pass 2 dir Y distance 100.0 speed 5.0 init_heading 1 :pre

[Description:]

This command is used in the "potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html
application to specify the parameters of the pass subcomponent of a
raster pattern.  Multiple passes can be defined in a single input
file, using unique id values.

Note that the {dir} value specifies direction of motion and
orientation of the molten pool during a pass.  The pool has its own
local coordinate system {x,y} so that the pool axis {x} is always
oriented along {dir d}. {init_heading} can be specified to start movement
along {dir} axis ({0}; default) or in negative direction.

The {distance} value {D} should typically be the size of the
simulation box in the xy-plane.

The example commands above define two passes, each with a different
orientation, speed, and heading.  The sketch below also illustrates the
{overpass}; the pool position is always translated by the {distance}
specfied plus an {overpass} increment.  The {overpass} increment is
computed as shown based upon parameters set in the
"app_potts_additive"_app_potts_additive.html command.
