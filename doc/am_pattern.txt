pattern command :h3

[Syntax:]

pattern id num_layers n layer_ids l_ids z_start z_init z_increment dz :pre

id = integer pattern identification number. :ul
num_layers n = keyword/value pair; integer {n} specifies number of unique layers for this pattern. :ul
layer_ids 1..n = keyword/value pair; Array (length {n}) of integer ids specifying layer(s) which should be used in this pattern. Defined with "cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html. :ul
z_start z_init = keyword/value pair; floating point value {z_init} is the initial z-value elevation for the pattern. Should typically be <= molten zone depth for complete coverage. :ul
z_increment dz = keyword/value pair; floating point value {dz} specifies z-elevation increment between layers. Should typically be <= molten zone depth for complete coverage and get overlap. :ul

[Examples:]

pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0 :pre
transverse_pass 1 distance 65.0 increment 10 :pre
cartesian_layer 1 start_position 30 30 pass_id 1 transverse_pass_id 1 serpentine 0 :pre
cartesian_layer 2 start_position 30 30 pass_id 1 transverse_pass_id 1 serpentine 1 :pre
pattern 1 num_layers 2 layer_ids 1 2 z_start 0.0 z_increment 5.0 :pre

The above {pattern} builds on the example from
"cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html; two layers are used to define a
repeating raster {pattern} as the tool builds a {3D} volume layer by layer
incrementally in the spparks {z} coordinate direction.  The first layer is
added beginning with a {z} elevation of {z=z_start=0.0}; the second layer is
added at an elevation of {z_increment=5.0}.  Since the {pattern} only has 2
layers, it repeats {layer 1} beginning at {z=10.0} and {layer 2} at {z=15.0};
the pattern continues to repeat for the duration of the simulation with each
layer added incrementally above the previous layer.


[Description:]

This command is used in the "potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html
application to specify the raster pattern used in a simulation. A pattern allows
for the use of multiple predefined layers.

As mentioned above, a pattern can be defined with an arbitrary number of
layers.  Each layer is seperated by an increment in the z-elevation.  Once all
of the layers have been cycled through, the pattern repeats itself be cycling
through the layers again and again until the simulation is completed.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html application.
