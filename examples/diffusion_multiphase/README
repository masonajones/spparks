Examples in this directory demonstrate use of diffusion/multiphase app.  Input
scripts for each example:

* in.pairwise_weights
* in.pin_filler
* in.variable_volume_fraction

The examples can be run in serial or parallel; log files for parallel runs (on
8 processors) are included in this directory.  Log files demonstrate what a
normal spparks run should nominally look like on 8 processors for the above
scripts.  On 8 processors, the examples run in less than 5 minutes.

* log.pairwise_weights.June22.2021.linux.8
* log.pin_filler.June22.2021.linux.8
* log.variable_volume_fraction.June22.2021.linux.8

The examples demonstrate use of all the app specific (diffusion/multiphase)
commands; the input scripts are also documentated for ease of use 
and understanding.

Each example dumps a stitch file and 4 images (jpeg) representing the 
evolution of two different phases constrained by a pinned filler phase.
