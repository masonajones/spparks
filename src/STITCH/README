JOHN: edit as you wish

The STITCH package adds a dump stitch and set stitch commands which
enable SPPARKS to do large-scale parallel writes and reads of its
lattice values to single large file.

It uses the Stitch library, available at http://...
which manages the structure and access to the file.
Stitch was developed by Jan and John (email address and institution).

That library can be downloaded and built in lib/stitch or elsewhere on
your system, which must be done before bulding SPPARKS with this
package.  Details of the download, build, and install process for the
Stitch library are given in the lib/stitch/README file, and an
Install.py is provided to help automate the process.  Also see
Section_start.html of the SPPARKS manual for general information on
building SPPARKS with packages and the Stitch library.

Once you have successfully built SPPARKS with this package and the
Stitch library, you can test it using an input file from the
examples/stitch dir.  See its README file for further instrucations.
