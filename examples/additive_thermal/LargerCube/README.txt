This example directory includes a Python script (Gcode.py) that can be used to convert between G-code files generated by slicing software to the laser path file format used by SPPARKS. It also contains an example g-code file(20mm_cube.gcode).

The default G-code format the script reads can be generated using the "RepRap" profile in the open source Slic3r program (https://slic3r.org).

The laser path files used by SPPARKS are 5-column comma-separated text files. The first 3 columns are x, y, and z coordinates that are linearly interpolated between to define the scan path. The 4th column is the cumulative distance of the scan path. The 5 column is the "Pause Flag", which defines whether a laser is on (flag = 0), the simulation is going through a long pause with the laser off as during recoating (flag = 1), or if the simulation is going through a short pause with the laser off as during repositioning within a layer (flag = 2).

The current simulation input file is configured to only simulate the first two layers of the build. The input path file (path.txt) has specifications for 20 layers, and the entire build can be simulated by lengthening the run time and increasing the size of the simulation box's Z-dimension.

Running this example simulation in parallel is recommended for best performance.
