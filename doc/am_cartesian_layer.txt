cartesian_layer command :h3

[Syntax:]

cartesian_layer layer_id start_position x y pass_id p_id transverse_pass_id t_id serpentine switch :pre

layer_id = integer identification number for this cartesian_layer. :ul
start_position x y = keyword/value pair; floating point values {(x,y)} specify coordinates of initial molten zone location (typically the bottom-left corner of the box). :ul
pass_id p_id = keyword/value pair; integer {p_id} which identifies pass to use for this layer (specified by the "pass"_am_pass.html command). :ul
transverse_pass_id t_id = keyword/value pair; integer {t_id} specifies transverse_pass to use on this layer (specified by the "transverse_pass"_am_transverse_pass.html command). :ul
serpentine switch = keyword/value pair; integer {switch} specifying whether each pass should be parallel or anti-parallel to the previous one. {switch = 0} for parallel and {1} for anti-parallel. :ul

[Examples:]

pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0 :pre
transverse_pass 1 distance 65.0 increment 10 :pre
cartesian_layer 1 start_position 30 30 pass_id 1 transverse_pass_id 1 serpentine 0 :pre
cartesian_layer 2 start_position 30 30 pass_id 1 transverse_pass_id 1 serpentine 1 :pre

In the above example, two unique layers (with and without serpentine) are
created. Note re-use of "pass"_am_pass.html and
"transverse_pass"_am_transverse_pass.html definitions.  Schematic sketch below
depicts the two layers.  Note how {overpass} interacts with {serpentine}.

[Description:]

This command is used in the "potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html
application to specify the cartesian_layer subcomponent of a raster "pattern"_am_pattern.html.
Multiple cartesian_layers can be defined in a single input file, using unique
id values.

The {start_position (x,y)} key/value pair is "pass"_am_pass.html sensitive.  If
a pass has {dir X}, then the start_position should be at the lower left corner
of raster domain (as defined by the pass and transverse_pass). If on the other
hand, the pass has {dir Y}, then the start position should be at the lower
right corner of the raster domain; see sketch of such a case in the "pass"_am_pass.html command.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style
potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html application.

[Related commands:]

"pass"_am_pass.html
"transverse_pass"_am_transverse_pass.html
"pattern"_am_pattern.html

[Default:] none
