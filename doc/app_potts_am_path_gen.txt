app_style potts/am/path/gen command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style potts/am/path/gen :pre

potts/am/path/gen = application style name :l

:ule

[Examples:]

app_style potts/am/path/gen :pre

This app does not have any app specific parameters.  It does however 
require AM raster commands listed below.

[Description:]

This is a specialized additive manufacturing (AM) application.   The app
generates a sequence of computational volumes (CV) which correspond with AM
raster paths on rectangular domains; it  runs very quickly and does not need to
be run in parallel.

Based upon user input commands to this app as well as other SPPARKS am
commands, CV and path information is generated with appropriate overlap
between CVs.  The sequence of CVs generated are ordered according to the am
build specified; the union of CVs forms the final 3D rectangular volume over which
microstructures are simulated.  

Using output from this app (CV and raster path information), microstructures on
3D rectangular volumes can be simulated in an incremental way much the same way
an additive manufactured part is built.  SPPARKS simulations are conducted on
each CV and stitched together by appending results from each simulation to the
output stitch database. AM microstructure simulations conducted this way
require substantially reduced computational resources, both memory and mpi cpu
resources, when compared to what would be required if the entire domain was
instantiated for one large simulation.  Starting and stopping the sequence of
runs is a highly flexible restart capability for AM microstructure simulations.  

To generated CV and raster path information, the "am pathgen"_am_pathgen.html
command, supplied by this app, must be in the user input script; the 
script should also include "am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html and "am
pass"_am_pass.html commands which specify the rectangular domain as well as
raster path information.  


The examples/stitch/stitching_rectangular_domain contains 
an example demonstrating use of this app. There are 3 primary 
elements to the example: 1) in.path_gen -- input script which 
uses this app; 2) in.am -- input script for a generic AM SPPARKS 
simulation parameterized; 3) stitch_rectangle.sh -- bash script 
which orchestrates the overall set of simulations.  Very limited 
editing of bash script is required -- only path to spparks executable 
is needed at top of script.  Remaining parameters should be specified 
by in.path_gen and in.am.  See directory for further explanation.

:line

The following commands are needed by this application.  A layer must be defined
using the "am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html command; at least one
"am pass"_am_pass.html command is required for each "am
cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html specified.  Following these commands
in the input script, the "am pathgen"_am_potts_path_gen.html command must be
specified to generate output CV and raster information;  this command must 
follow all of the "am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html and "am
pass"_am_pass.html commands in the input script.

"am pass"_am_pass.html: Specify pass parameters used to construct
{cartesian_layer}. :ulb,l


"am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html: A scan pattern on
rectangular layer constructed from {am pass} and other parameters. :l

"am pathgen"_am_build.html: May be used for combinations of layers that
comprise a pattern. :l,ule

:line

[Restrictions:] :link(restriction)

This application will only generate paths specified by 
the "am cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html command and 
associated "am pass"_am_pass.html commands.
