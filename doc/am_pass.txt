pass command :h3

[Syntax:]

pass id dir d distance D velocity V :pre

id = integer identification number for this pass. :ul
dir d = keyword/value pair; {d} is a single character {X} or {Y} which specifies direction of the cartesian pass :ul
distance D = keyword/value pair; {D} is floating point number specifying the total pass distance (typically the size of the simulation box in xy-plane) :ul
velocity V = keyword/value pair; {V} is a floating point number which specifes the scan velocity of the pass in sites/MCS :ul

[Examples:]

pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0 :pre
pass 2 dir Y distance 100.0 speed 5.0 :pre

Two passes are defined each with a different orientation and speed.  The sketch
below also illustrates the {overpass}; the pool position is always translated
by the {distance} specfied plus an {overpass} increment.  The {overpass}
increment is computed as shown based upon parameters set in
"app_potts_additive"_app_potts_additive.html.

[Description:]

This command is used in the "potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html
application to specify the parameters of the pass subcomponent of a raster
pattern. Multiple passes can be defined in a single input file, using unique id
values.  

Note that {dir d} key/value pair specifies direction of motion and orientation
of the molten pool during a pass.  The pool has its own local coordinate system {x,y} 
so that the pool axis {x} is always oriented along {dir d}.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html application.
