app_style potts/strain/with/pinning command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style potts/strain/with/pinning Q :pre

potts/strain/with/pinning = application style name
Q = number of spin states :ul

[Examples:]

app_style potts/strain/with/pinning 100 :pre

[Description:]

This is an on-lattice application which evolves a Q-state Potts model with a
per-site strain, where each lattice site has a spin value from 1 to Q;  the app
also allows for pinning of sites using a special spin value of Q+1.  Sites flip
their spin as the model evolves but sites are not allowed to flip to a pinned
value; sites with pinned values also do not flip.  Strain energy can influence
grain growth.

See "potts_strain"_app_potts_strain.html and "pin"_pin.html for details
on how strain and pinned sites are incorporated into this app.
