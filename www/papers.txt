SPPARKS Papers :h3

This technical report is the best overall description of SPPARKS and
its applications and algorithms.  Please cite this report and the
"SPPARKS WWW page"_sws, if you use SPPARKS in a paper:

[Crossing the Mesoscale No-Man's Land via Parallel Kinetic Monte
Carlo], S. Plimpton, C. Battaile, M. Chandross, L. Holm,
A. Thompson, V. Tikare, G. Wagner, E. Webb, X. Zhou, C. Garcia
Cardona, A. Slepoy, Sandia report SAND2009-6226, October
2009. ("abstract"_abstracts/sand09.html)

You can download the entire report via "this
link"_pdf/sand09.pdf, but note that it is a 45 Mb file!

This paper is about a sintering application developed for SPPARKS by
Cristina Garcia Cardona.  Time-evolution pictures of the process the
model can simlulate can be found on "this page"_pictures.html.

[Parallel Simulation of 3D Sintering], C. G. Cardona, V. Tikare,
S. J. Plimpton, Int J Computational Materials Science and Surface
Engineering, 4, 37-54 (2011).  ("abstract"_abstracts/ijcmsse11.html)

This paper describes the most novel KMC or event-selection algorithm
in SPPARKS, a constant-time composition-rejection algorithm, whose
cost to select a single event is independent of the total number of
available events:

[A Constant-Time Kinetic Monte Carlo Algorithm for Simulation of Large
Biochemical Reaction Networks], A. Slepoy, A. P. Thompson,
S. J. Plimpton, J Chem Phys, 128, 205101
(2008). ("abstract"_abstracts/jcp08.html)

If you send us information about a paper that uses SPPARKS results,
we'll be pleased to add info about it to this page.  Ditto for a
picture or movie for the "Pictures & Movies"_pictures.html page.
