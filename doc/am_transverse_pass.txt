transverse_pass command :h3

[Syntax:]

transverse_pass id distance D increment I :pre

id = integer identification number for this transverse_pass. :ul
distance D = keyword/value pair; {D} is a floating point number for the total length covered by the transverse pass (typically the box size transverse to the current pass direction). :ul
increment I = keyword/value pair; {I} is a floating point specifying the transverse distance between each pass. Typically smaller than the molten zone width to achieve full coverage :ul

[Examples:]

pass 1 dir X distance 100.0 speed 10.0 :pre
transverse_pass 1 distance 65.0 increment 10 :pre

In the above example, a pass along the "spparks" {X} axis is defined.  The
transverse_pass command defines the distance {increment 10} between each pass
as well as implicitly defining the number of passes based upon the 
keyword/value pair {distance 10.0}.  Schematic sketch below depicts example.

[Description:]

This command is used in the "potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html
application to specify the parameters of the transverse_pass subcomponent of a
raster pattern. Multiple transverse passes can be defined in a single input
file, using unique id values.

The {increment I} key/value pair defines the transverse distance between 
passes defined in the "pass"_am_pass.html command.  The {distance D} 
key/value pair used together with {I} implicitly defines number passes 
when used to define a "rectangular_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html.

[Restrictions:]

This command can only be used as part of the "app_style potts/additive"_app_potts_additive.html application.

[Related commands:]

"pass"_am_pass.html
"cartesian_layer"_am_cartesian_layer.html
"pattern"_am_pattern.html

[Default:] none
