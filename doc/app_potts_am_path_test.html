<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This app is used for testing input scripts associated with additive
manufacturing; in particular path commands.  The app parses and processes the
commands listed below.  Subsequently it prints information that may be useful
for debugging input paths.  Additional information may also be obtained by
editing the source code 'app_potts_am_path_test.cpp' or the header
'app_potts_am_path_test.h' to print or process additional information.  The app
runs very quickly and is also useful for computing how many Monte Carlo sweeps
are needed to complete the 'am path' information specified.
</P>
<P>The examples/am_path/cartesian_path_test directory has 8 small tests 
which demonstrate the use of this app. Screen and log file outputs 
are the main source of information generated by this app.

<P>The following commands are typically used by this
application.  A layer must be defined by using <A HREF = "am_cartesian_layer.html">am
cartesian_layer</A> or <A HREF = "am_path_layer.html">am
path_layer</A>.  A layer requires one to many <A HREF = "am_path.html">am
path</A> commands or at least one <A HREF = "am_pass.html">am pass</A>
command.
</P>
<UL><LI><A HREF = "am_pass.html">am pass</A>: Specify pass parameters used to construct
<I>cartesian_layer</I>. 

<LI><A HREF = "am_path.html">am path</A>: Specify arbitrary paths via start/end points
on a layer; sequence of <I>am path</I>s are used to construct an <A HREF = "am_path_layer.html">am
path_layer</A>. 

<LI><A HREF = "am_cartesian_layer.html">am cartesian_layer</A>: A scan pattern on
rectangular layer constructed from <I>am pass</I> and other parameters. 

<LI><A HREF = "am_build.html">am build</A>: May be used for combinations of layers that
comprise a pattern.
