app_style potts/weld command :h3

[Syntax:]

app_style style nspins yp width length alpha beta velocity haz

style = potts/weld
nspins = number of possible Potts model spins :l
yp = initial melt pool position along y-axis :l
width = principal dimension of ellipse and maximum width of the melt pool along x-axis :l
length = principal dimension of ellipse and maximum width of the melt pool along y-axis :l
alpha = controls relative size of melt pool shape at bottom compared to top :l
beta = Bezier control point parameter that defines curvature of melt pool shape through thickness  :l
velocity = velocity of melt pool motion (lattice sites per Monte Carlo step) :l
haz = width of the heat affected zone (haz) surrounding the melt pool :l
:ule

[Examples:]

app_style  potts/weld 10000   0   100.0   150.0   0.5   0.75   7.0   50.0

This defines a potts/weld model with 10000 spins. The elliptical weld pool is 100 sites 
wide and 150 sites long at the top surface of the plates welded; the parameter {alpha} 
specifies that the elliptical pool shape at the bottom surface is 50 sites wide by 75 sites 
long.  The Bezier control point parameter specifies an outwardly curved pool; the weld 
speed is 7 MCS and the heat effect zone is 50 sites wide.

This is an on-lattice application derived from the "app_style
potts/neighonly"_app_potts.html; it simulates grain growth associated with a
butt-weld process. Two sheets of material of equal thickness are assumed to be
just touching; this defines a joint to be welded. Grain growth associated with joining
the plates in a weld process is simulated  by translating a weld pool
(simulates melt) along the joint (aligned with the y-coordinate axis).  The
weld pool is translated with a speed defined by {velocity}.  The weld pool
geometry is defined by an ellipse {width} and {length} along the x and y
coordinate axes respectively; this defines the pool size and shape at the top
surface of the plates joined. It is assumed that the weld fully penetrates the
thickess of the plates;  the parameter 1>={alpha}>0 defines the ellipse {width} 
and length at the bottom of the plates relative to the top.  The thickness 
of the plates joined is assumed to be the number of lattice sites along the 
z-axis defined in "region"_region.html command.
Curvature of the pool in the plate thickness direction is controlled by the
parameter 1>={beta}>=0; when {beta} is less than 0.5, the slope of the pool surface
is increasing from top to bottom; when {beta} is greater than 0.5, the slope of
the pool surface is decreasing from top to bottom.

The model simulates melting and re-solidification by randomizing the spin at a
lattice site when it falls within the melt pool's volume. Upon exiting the melt
pool, a rejection kinetic Monte Carlo event is performed at the site, and the
spin is flipped to the value of one of its neighbors (in the style of the
"potts/neighonly"_app_potts.html application).

The mobility of each site within the {haz} decreases linearly with increasing
distance from the melt pool surface. The maximum mobility is 1 at the melt pool
boundary and the minimum mobility is 0 at the outer boundary of the heat 
affected zone as defined by {haz}. The mobility
gradient is similar to that in "potts/grad"_app_potts_grad.html, but is
restricted to a smaller portion of the simulation domain as defined by 
the heat affected zone parameter {haz}.

Outside of the melt pool and heat affected zone, grain boundary mobility is set
to 0, and grain evolution does not occur.

Use the "read_sites"_read_sites.html command to initialize the microstructure
of plates welded; alternatively the "set"_set.html command can be used to
initialize the base metal microstructure.

Use the "pulse"_pulse.html command to simulate pulsed arc power.
